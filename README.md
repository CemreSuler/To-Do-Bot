This README is temporary and I will write an extensive one very soon!

GoForIt (will find a new name soon) is a discord bot that helps yourself or your organisation with managing tasks.

For now you will have to host it yourself but I will try to get a sever to host it on in the near future!

Dependencies: DiscordPy

Main file: Bot.py

Main discord command: td!setup (it will do everything for you, isn't that nice)
